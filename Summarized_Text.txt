Itis for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced

Itis rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ~ that from these honored
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion —
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.
